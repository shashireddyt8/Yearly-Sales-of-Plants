## 4. Features / Highlights

### ‚Ä¢ Business Problem

Global sales teams and category managers lack visibility into real-time performance trends, underperforming markets, and gross profit drivers‚Äîespecially when tracking results year over year by region and product type.

### ‚Ä¢ Goal of the Dashboard

To empower stakeholders with a unified analytics view to:

- Compare **Year-To-Date (YTD)** and **Prior Year-To-Date (PYTD)** sales performance  
- Identify bottom-performing countries  
- Spot seasonal spikes and product trends  
- Analyze **Gross Profit Percentage (GP%)** to evaluate profitability  
- Drill into account-level performance to detect revenue and margin outliers  

### ‚Ä¢ Walkthrough of Key Visuals

  - YTD Quantity: **555.66K**  
  - YTD vs PYTD Growth: **+17.05K**

  - Gross Profit %: **0.40**

- **Bottom 10 Countries by YTD vs PYTD (Treemap)**  
  Highlights underperforming regions like China, France, Sweden, and Japan with specific shortfalls in quantity sold.

## 5. Business Impact & Insights

- üìä **Seasonality Uncovered**: Peak performance is seen in Q2 and Q4, with July and September experiencing noticeable drops‚Äîlikely linked to operational or demand-side seasonality.
